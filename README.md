# Better RTX Installer MCLauncher Fork

This is a fork of the official BetterRTX Installer that does not require IObit. This version will only work if you installed the game in a different directory than the protected directory Microsoft forces you to install by default. This fork will not be updated as often and will more than likely never get the v2 treatment. If you want a fancy GUI, please support the original developers by checking out their repo this was forked from. This was just a project to suit my personal needs and shared it if anyone else would want to use it.

 

Due to not being in a protected area, we can use normal powershell copy/delete commands to push the files, automating the process of moving the files without needing to use a program (OIbit as an example) to escalate privileges higher than Microsoft wants us to attain.

### Prerequisites

[download](https://github.com/Uzephi/BetterRTX-Installer/releases) the installer script

- Use software like
  [MCLauncher](https://github.com/MCMrARM/mc-w10-version-launcher) or
  [Bedrock Launcher](https://github.com/BedrockLauncher/BedrockLauncher) to
  easily create a side-loaded Minecraft installation.

## Installation

Right click the `installer.ps1` file and select _Run with PowerShell_ to start the installer script.
