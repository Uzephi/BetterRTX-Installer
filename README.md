# Better RTX Installer MCLauncher Fork

This is a fork of the official BetterRTX Installer that does not require IObit. This version will only work if you installed the game in a different directory than the protected directory Microsoft forces you to install by default. 

Due to not being in a protected area, we can use normal poweershell copy/delete commands to push the files, automating the process of moving the files without needing to use a program (OIbit as an example) to escalate priviledges higher than Microsoft wants us to attain.

## Installation

> [download](https://github.com/Uzephi/BetterRTX-Installer/releases) the installer script
### Prerequisites

- Use software like
  [MCLauncher](https://github.com/MCMrARM/mc-w10-version-launcher) or
  [Bedrock Launcher](https://github.com/BedrockLauncher/BedrockLauncher) to
  easily create a side-loaded Minecraft installation.

## Usage

Entering the [installation command](#installation) will invoke the [installer script](v2/installer.ps1), backup the Minecraft files to mod, then open a __BetterRTX Installer__ window.

### Quick Start
1. Select the Minecraft installation instance(s) to modify.
2. Select a preset from the list.
3. Click __Install__ to download and copy the mod files into the selected instances.
4. [Enjoy](#screenshots) ðŸ˜Ž

##### Uninistall

Selecting the _Uninstall_ option will revert the BetterRTX Installer's changes and remove its cached files.
